This repository 1) trains a pre-trained Inception model on custom images and 2) computes saliency methods for regression for these images primarily using 2 different packages

This is a work in progress

This work is based on https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.03292.pdf, but applying these methods to images that are medical in nature (from the Bone Age dataset) and classified using regression
